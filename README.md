# myStuffFrontend
Contains basic HTML landing page to perform CRUD operations in MyStuff DB in Backend
All content is created by the Javascript file, which alters the HTML body accordingly
Still to be done: code review to reduce duplicate code, e.g. the openModal-functions coudld be condensed into one, the modal definition itself could be condensed into one, the selection of POST vs. PUT method could be handled in one function.
